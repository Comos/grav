In multi-user web applications, resources could or couldn't be operated concurrently. Generally, we try to keep the data safe and consistent with several modes such as Optimistic Lock, Pessimistic Lock, Version Control, etc. Comos/Grav is such a project to build a Node.js based service and clients to support data consistency keeping and multi-user reminding.
